## 📸 Scenario
You own Gelato Mágico, a cozy ice cream shop in a seaside town. Over time, you’ve noticed a clear pattern: the hotter the day, the more ice cream you sell.

However, producing the right amount is a challenge:

* ❄️ Producing too much → waste, losses, and spoiled inventory.

* 🔥 Producing too little → missed sales and unhappy customers.

To address this challenge, we developed a **regression model** that predicts daily sales based on temperature, allowing more precise production planning.
